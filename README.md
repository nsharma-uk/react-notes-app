##Highlights and Next Steps

- This project was useful in providing more experience and familiarity of React Hooks, in particular useContext. The next React project will focus on the useReducer Hook.

- This time I used CSS to add a global style to the app. In the next React project I am going to focus on theme styles, using a ThemeProvider to bring in styles to the components.
